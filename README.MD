### Usage

Build & run [CaptureSharp.GUI](CaptureSharp.GUI).

### .NET Version

.NET Framework 4.8

### Benchmarks

There's a simple benchmark in 
[CaptureSharp.Benchmarks](CaptureSharp.Benchmarks)
that measures time required to capture a window 
associated with `rider64` process
([JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)). If you
use something else, you may want to edit 
[CaptureBenchmark.cs](CaptureSharp.Benchmarks/CaptureBenchmark.cs)
accordingly.
